# Search App

This is an application that uses the Torre API endpoints to search for individuals and then displays matching individuals to the search term entered into the app. The app also enables one to see the last 10 most recent searches as well as add and/or remove favorite matching individuals from the search results.

## Requirements

This application was built as part of a technical test with the following requirements:

- Construct a page allowing users to search for names, displaying a list of matching individuals. Take inspiration from **[the torre.ai search](https://torre.ai/search/people-name)**.

- Upon clicking a search result, users should be directed to their genome. This can be either directly on [torre.ai](http://torre.ai/) or through your own implementation.

Additionally, implement **_one or both_** of the following features:

- Display a list showcasing up to 10 of the most recent search queries.
- Provide an option for users to save or favorite individuals and ensure this list is easily accessible.
